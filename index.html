				<ul>
					<li>
						Collaborated with ComNets Lab at NYUAD for my undergraduate thesis

					<li>
						Developed JSLite, an ML-based browser plugin for optimizing the websites’ performance by automatically removing unnecessary parts of the JavaScript code present in them 		
					</li>
					<li>
						Evaluated the plugin on 500 popular pages and the results showed that the plugin reduced the Mean Page Load Time by 50% while retaining above 90% similarity with the original pages
